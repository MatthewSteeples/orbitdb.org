# orbitdb.org

> The website for OrbitDB

This is the planned website for the OrbitDB project. At the moment, this website is a **WIP**. Your mileage may vary, use at your own risk, &c., &c.

## Plan of action

Original author: Richard Littauer. Feel free to reach out to me over your favorite messaging medium.

This will be a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub Pages (and perhaps on Netlify), because that seems the easiest at the moment.

See the issues for more. I'll be dropping TODOs throughout the code.


## Usage

### Testing the site locally

TODO

### Adding a post

### Adding Images

Read [this document](images/src/README.md) to learn how to add and optimize images.

## Contribute

Right now, this is not a design-by-committee work. I'm working on the main draft of the site, and will look for feedback, but I'm trying to get it up and in a reasonable shape before overhauling it too much with fixes. That having been said, please feel free to get involved! Open an issue before opening a PR, unless it's small and I've messed up with the spelling.

### Attribution

This site was seeded from a website originally made, and then edited (by me), for the Zcash Foundation. You can find that site [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zfnd.io).
